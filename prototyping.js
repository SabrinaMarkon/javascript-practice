/* Prototyping */

/* 
Almost (not the default object or null objects) every object in JS has an internal property that is a reference to another object. It is linked to another object. This linked object is called the prototype.

Objects inherit properties and methods from its prototype ancestry.

prototype chain: object <- object's prototype <- object's object's prototype - inherits properties and methods down the chain.

Prototype is automatically assigned, but we can DEFINE an object's prototype!
